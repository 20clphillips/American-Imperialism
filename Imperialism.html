<center><h1>The Reasons</h1></center>
<p>America completed with neighboring countries for territory,
because of certian interests and needs. Economically, industries and trades
Militarilly, we need bases to refuel ships in foriegn waters and stragic adv.
Ideologically, nationalist americans believe the best way to increase its influence
was to indulge in territorial conquests. All of these reasons caused a race to
seize as much territory as possible.</p>

<center><h1>Acquisition of Alaska</h1></center>
<p>In 1867, William H. Seward, President Andrew Johnson's secretary of state, eyed Alaska like a buzzard eyes roadkill.  The frozen territory was filled with wildlife for hunting, woods for timber, and metals for industry.  However, there were a bunch ding dongs running the show in Congress, and they were completely ignorant of just how valuable the Alaskan territory was.  They taunted Seward calling Alaska, Seward's Icebox or Seward's Folly.  However, despite the constant negative press,  Seward managed to buy Alaska for 7.2 million U.S.  The criticism stopped when gold and oil were discovered in the territory, and the benefits started rolling in.</p>

<center><h1>Acquisition of Hawaii</h1></center>
<p>After the discovery of Hawaii in 1778, by British Captain James Cook,  the Hawaiian people united under a monarch leadership.  After the discovery, early settlers brought the business of sugar cane farming to the islands, and in 1875 the  Monarch of Hawaii,  King Kalakua issued a treaty that allowed Hawaiian made sugar to enter the US. However Kalakua was a nationalist and was angered by foreign influence in his country.  This made him the target of a group of American business leaders called the Hawaiian League, who wanted to keep their influence in Hawaii.  In 1886, the Hawaiian League forced King Kalakua to sign a treaty at gun point, a treaty, called the bayonet constitution, that limited Kalakua's power and deprived many Hawaiians of the right to vote.  When King Kalakua died in 1891, his sister Liliuokalani, who shared his nationalist views,  became queen and declared a plan to break the bayonet constitution.  However,  an American minister named John L. Stevens, secretly sent four boats filled with US Marines to help a Hawaiian rebel take the royal palace.  Queen Liliuokalani was forced to surrender, and a regime took control over the islands.  While Congress planned to annex Hawaii and make it another American state, but the current American President was unable to assist the Queen.  A stalemate lasted till the next president supported the Annexation, and made Hawaii an American state.</p>

<center><h1>Spanish-American War</h1></center>
<p>In 1890’s Spain had controlled the Western Hemisphere colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico, which kind of ticked off the Cubans.  They staged several revolts in 1868, but none of them did anything, and the leaders of the revolt were exiled.  However, one of these leaders named Jose Marti, went to New York and tried to rile up his fellow Cubans.  He returned to his country to start another revolution but was killed in the battle that ensued.  He became a martyr to his fellow Cubans, who continued to war against the Spanish Army.  While all this is happening, American newspapers are competing for business, causing them to take giant leaps to ensure business such as exaggerating stories and dramatizing certain elements.  Basically, the old-fashioned form of click bait.  Anyway, one of these newspapers called the San Francisco Examiner, sent out a reporter and an artist to write and capture the war down in Cuba, but when they arrived they realized there was not much happening as far as war.  When the reporter told his publisher named William R. Hearst about this, Hearst stated:

                 “You furnish the pictures, I’ll furnish the war.” William R. Hearst.

This led to controversy over what part Hearst played in the US’s involvement in the Cuba.  But eventually the America entered the conflict when the battleship the USS Maine exploded in Havana Harbor killing 260 sailors.  After this, President William McKinley demanded Spain to grant Cuba it’s independence, which Spain refused to do.  So, President McKinley declared war on Spain on April 25, 1898 starting the Spanish American War.  The entire war lasted only four months and only 2000 soldiers died mostly due to yellow fever.  The US gained the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, but the war cost the US about $250 million dollars.</p>

<center><h1>America & Puerto Rico</h1></center>
<p>After the Spanish American war, the US had gained the island of Puerto Rico.  However, unlike Cuba, the US governed Puerto Rico as a territory like it did with the Philippines.  The Foraker Act established an upper and lower house of legislature, while the US appointed the governor for the upper house the Puerto Ricans elected the lower.  In 1917, the US gave citizenship to Puerto Ricans, and allowed them to vote for all the legislative offices.  In 1952 Puerto Rico established its own governing system but today the US still decides most of its domestic affairs, such as interstate trade, immigration, and military affairs.</p>

<center><h1>America & Cuba</h1></center>
<p>After the Spanish American War, things ran a little different than in Puerto Rico.  An outbreak of yellow fever had plagued the US Troops during the war, and caused many of the casualties throughout the conflict.  Two US Army doctors named Walter Reed and William C. Gorgas, tested the theory by Cuban doctor Carlos Juan Finlay that mosquitoes spread the yellow fever.  Over the span of a year, Gorgas organized an initiative to drain any pools of stagnant water where mosquitoes bred.  This eliminated almost all traces of yellow fever in the city of Havana. After the war, the US feared that Cuba might be snatched up by other imperialist nations or disrupt American business there.  However the US had promise not to annex Cuba, so instead the US inserted the Platt Amendment into the new Cuban Constitution, which narrowed its ability to sign treaties with other nations.  It also demanded Cuba to lease land for naval and coal stations.  The Platt Amendment basically made Cuba a protectorate country, which is a country under the protection of another.</p>

<center><h1>America & the Philippines</h1></center>
<p>After the Spanish American War,  America was debating on whether or not to annex the Philippines.   While some people were disturbed by the idea of controlling an overseas country,  others thought it would benefit America and the Philippians.  President McKinley himself favored annexation.  On February 6, 1899,  a treaty allowed for the annexation of the Philippines, but a Filipino nationalist named Emilio Aguinaldo had set up himself as president and he threatened to fight any US military action in his country.  Soon fighting broke out and a conflict erupted in the Philippines that lasted 3 years and claimed the lives of over 4000 US soldiers and more than 220,000 Filipinos.  The US forced Aguinaldo out of power.  Years later the Philippines were granted independence on July 4, 1946.</p>

<center><h1>America & China</h1></center>
<p>America had engaged in trade with China since 1784, yet China still remained gridlocked, isolating itself from the rest of the world.  Using spheres of influence, areas where certain nations have power over the real owner of the land, many European powers tried to gain economic and political control in China.  The US was late to the party and did not have its own sphere of influence, and feared being shut out from the nation entirely.  To counter this, in 1899 Secretary of State John Hay,  pushed the Open Door Policy, which would give all nations equal trade opportunity in China.  Secretary Hay, sent this plan to other European nations, who did not accept the plan but did not reject it either.  So Secretary Hay announced on March 1900 that the Open Door Policy was approved.  This eventually led to the organization called the Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists, known as Boxers in Western countries.  The Boxers attacked the capital city of Beijing, which became known as the Boxer Rebellion.  However, many Western nations sent over 20,000 troops, along with 2,000 Americans, to stop the rebellion.  And on September 1901, China signed a treaty to end the conflict.  The Boxer Rebellion drew support for the Open Door Policy, and soon Western nations used it to exploit the Chinese trade.</p>

<center><h1>Roosevelt & Foreign Policy</h1></center>
<p>one of Roosevelt's famous quotes is "speak softly and carry a big stick" which means his naval power was very strong and the idea is negotiating peacefully but also having strength in case things go wrong. Simultaneously threatening with the "big stick", or the military. One of his later achievements is making the panama canal which helped with expanding his power to Cuba.it also helped restore ordet to the area.</p>
